### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

  Lab 1 was the very first lab where we started off the very first day with a simple "Hello World!". This one had just a slight twist with it being hello, but with the coders, names which were my partner and I! For me, even though this was a very simple and straightforward process, it really got me hooked on what the future assignments had in store for us.

* Lab 2

Lab 2, my second favorite lab because this is where my partner and I really put our formatting practice to the test! Although we had a rough start, we picked up the pace halfway through and really started to get it with the help of our TA's. This lab had us edit viral_math.cc, which basically had our program use simple PEMDAS to solve 8/2 (2 + 2) and when the user inputted the question, the program would give the correct answer.

* Lab 6

   Lab 6, my third favorite lab due to it being time-consuming, but a fun challenge yet again for my formatting. This program had us utilize vectors which store multiple items of the same type, which is what we used to store one hundred random numbers. Although it was a challenge at first, it really ensured I knew how to really format my code following Google's C++ guide.
